       <b>The rules of the game:</b> Before you will be <b>3</b> pictures, two below and one above.
        In two of them there will be numbers. You need to make sure that the <b>sum of the
        numbers</b> from the two bottom pictures is the same as
        the number on the top picture.\n\n <b>For example</b>, if the number <b>7</b> is on the top picture,
        and a question mark is on one of the bottom pictures and the number <b>4</b> is on the other,
        we must understand that the number <b>3</b> should be in the place of
        the question mark, because <b>3 + 4 = 7</b>.\n\n
        <b>Your task is to find the correct number so that the sum is correct!</b>"
